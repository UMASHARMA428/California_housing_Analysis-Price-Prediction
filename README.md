# The California housing dataset
This Model aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning in forecasting the price of houses in California. It explores how various features of a house, as well as its proximity to other houses and geographical location, influence its cost. While common factors like the number of rooms or distance from the coast are acknowledged, the focus lies in analyzing the precise impact of these factors and others on housing prices. 
The objective is to develop a predictive model capable of estimating house prices based on any combination of these variables.


## Descriptive Analysis
